note for the project

Goal: To uncover how olist can improve customer satisfaction and revenue by analyzing

Questions:
1. What % of orders are delivered late?
“We investigated delivery performance and found that X% of orders arrived late, with some regions performing worse than others. This is a critical insight for improving customer satisfaction.”
2. Which regions (states/cities) have the longest delivery times?
“Delivery speed varies by region — we mapped average delivery time and identified bottlenecks in logistics. This helps prioritize which areas need operational improvements.”
3. How do delivery delays affect customer review scores?
“We found a strong correlation between late deliveries and low review scores. This emphasizes how operational performance directly impacts customer sentiment.”
4. Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
“Some categories like electronics and furniture generate disproportionate revenue. This gives insight into which categories drive growth and where marketing should focus.”
5. Which sellers have the highest sales volume and best customer ratings?
“We built a seller performance dashboard combining revenue and ratings — revealing top performers and identifying poor-performing vendors.”
Bonus: Can we predict bad reviews using product, delivery, and seller info?
