### 3. Infomwr Assignment 3 - supervised learning competition
**Description:**
This assignment follows the **Common Task Framework (CTF)**.  
We were provided with a dataset containing student information, and our goal was to **predict academic performance**.  

In this project, we implemented and compared several supervised learning models — **Linear Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Random Forest** — to predict students' outcomes.  
Finally, we submitted our predictions to the designated “referee” system for evaluation.
