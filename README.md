# My Data Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! This repository showcases my data skills using real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Olist Project – E-commerce Data Analysis
**Description:**  
Analyzed Brazilian e-commerce data from Olist to study order delays and regional trends. Built a complete workflow from data ingestion to visualization.


**Repository:** [Olist Project](./olist_project)

## Courseworks

### 1. Infomwr Assignment 1 - database design and querying
**Description**
This assignment focuses on **relational database design, SQL querying, and Python-based data extraction**.  
We redesigned a company database by expanding the schema with new entities such as **Bill**, **Product**, and **Employee**, and defined both **one-to-many** and **many-to-many** relationships.  
Normalization was performed to ensure that the database schema satisfies **BCNF**.  

In the querying part, we implemented multiple **SQL queries** involving joins, aggregation, and nested subqueries.  
Finally, we used **Python (SQLite + Pandas)** to connect to the database, load tables into DataFrames, and applied a **Jaccard similarity function** to identify similar customer records.

**Respository:** [Infomwr Assignment 1](./Infomwr%20Assignment%201)

### 2.

### 3. Infomwr Assignment 3 - supervised learning competition
**Description:**
This assignment follows the **Common Task Framework (CTF)**.  
We were provided with a dataset containing student information, and our goal was to **predict academic performance**.  

In this project, we implemented and compared several supervised learning models — **Linear Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Random Forest** — to predict students' outcomes.  
Finally, we submitted our predictions to the designated “referee” system for evaluation.

## Future Plans
- Add more data analysis/data pipeline projects
- Expand portfolio with end-to-end analytics workflows
